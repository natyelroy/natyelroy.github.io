Animation for Visual Arts HSC 2020.
Animated by Natalie Leroy.
Music by Christopher Leroy.

I take the viewer on a journey through my world. I use animation to distort the everyday and challenge the audienceâ€™s conceptualisation of their surroundings. By juxtaposing realistic aspects with the imaginative, I show the interaction of objects and ideas that are beyond the ordinary.
