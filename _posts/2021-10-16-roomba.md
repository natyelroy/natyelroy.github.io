Animation for Hemans Chan's university project.

Animated by Natalie Leroy.
Concept by Monique Leroy.
Soundtrack by Hemans Chan.

Life is mundane and repetitive, well for nearly everyone... except Ro... a vacuum cleaner. Follow the adventures of Ro discovering the world, making friends and ultimately, finding their place in the world.

Software used: Premiere Pro and Adobe Animate.

## Natalie's Process

Project started August 2021 to October 2021. Over the 3 months, I worked in close collaboration with Hemans Chan. 

The idea of bringing a Roomba to life was through a conversation discussed with my sister, Monique. We loved the idea of making inanimate objects to life- like the pioneer of 3D-animation did, Toy Story. We also thought it would be fun to reimagine an ordinary object that is used for essential use but bring personality to it.

From there, I spoke with Hemans about the soundtrack. We bounced ideas off each other and I drafted up storyboards and character profiles, keeping her updated throughout the animation process, as well as editted according to feedback. Samples can be seen below.
