Animation for Visual Arts HSC 2020.

Animated by Natalie Leroy.
Music by Christopher Leroy.

I take the viewer on a journey through my world. I use animation to distort the everyday and challenge the audienceâ€™s conceptualisation of their surroundings. By juxtaposing realistic aspects with the imaginative, I show the interaction of objects and ideas that are beyond the ordinary.

Software used: Premiere Pro and Adobe Animate.

## Natalie's Process

This animation took over the course of a year to produce. I received frequent feedback on my work from my art teacher and modified my work accordingly. This can be seen at the beginning and ending. I cut quite a bit from the beginning and also editted the end to have more animation components.

I also worked in collaboration with my brother, Christopher. After finishing my animation, I screenshotted a few frames from each scene and printed it out. I then annotated each frame to explain what music and sounds I would like added. Christopher then made a few musical arrangement snippets for me to choose from and then creatively developed the soundtrack from there.
