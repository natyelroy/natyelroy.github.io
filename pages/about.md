Can we make visuals feel just like sounds? is a question that is constantly asked inside Natalie's mind and that is what her artworks aim to decipher.

Natalie is a 20 year old Media Arts and Computer Science undergraduate student. Her specialisations are animation and 3D visualisation. 

She has worked with a variety of people, within university societies as well as across different universities. Her passion for creativity and experimentation is evident in her precision and time dedicated to her work; whether that be animation, film editing or photography.

She displays her professional work on her YouTube under her name, [Natalie Leroy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1Gjm6yx2yt7ZeQ9Le6HaqQ). Additionally, Natalie spends her free time making short animations and animatics to music on another YouTube channel called [KitKadesa Shorts](https://www.youtube.com/@kitkadesasshorts/shorts). Her animations have amounted to over 900,000 views, which further proves her eye for detail and capturing her audience into the imaginative world she creates.

Natalie is looking to further develop her technical skills in the animation industry and is open to opportunities.
